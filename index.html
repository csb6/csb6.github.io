      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
	I am a sophomore student at the University of Arizona majoring in Computer Science
	and minoring in English.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am interested in systems programming, game design, computer simulations,
	and web programming.
	For the past three years, I have been working with a variety of
	technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
	My first two programming languages were JavaScript and Ruby,
	but since starting college I have gained a lot of experience in Python, which has
	become my primary language for prototypes and one-off scripts. Starting in December of
	2018, I have been teaching myself C++ alongside my studies, and I am currently
	in the process of making a small game in order to test my skills in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am also fascinating by logic programming, and any other unconventional
	programming techniques and tools I can get my hands on. I am always looking for
	new ways to efficiently write more correct and performant programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Things I've Done</h2>
      <p>
	Several of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/csb6">Github profile</a>.
	More descriptive information can be found on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
	From August 2018 to December 2019, I served as a Web/Poetry Intern at the
	<a href="sonorareview.com"><em>Sonora Review</em></a>, a student and graduate-run
	literary journal at the University of Arizona.
