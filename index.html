      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
	I am a sophomore student at the University of Arizona majoring in Computer Science
	and minoring in English.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am interested in systems programming, game design, computer simulations,
	and web programming.
	For the past three years, I have been working with a variety of
	technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
	My first two programming languages were JavaScript and Ruby,
	but since starting college I have gained experience in Python, which has
	become my primary language for prototypes and one-off scripts. Starting in December of
	2018, I have been teaching myself C++ alongside my studies, and recently I have
        been experimenting with the Ada language.
      </p>
      <p>
	I am also fascinated by logic programming, as well as any other unconventional
	programming techniques and tools I can get my hands on. I am always looking for
	new ways to efficiently write more correct and performant programs.
      </p>
      <h2>Things I've Done</h2>
      <p>
	Several of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/csb6">Github</a>.
	More descriptive information can be found on my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page.
      </p>
      <h2>Coursework</h2>
      <p>
        I am keeping a short log of the CS courses I take throughout college as a
        sort of record of my learning.
        <a href="coursework.html">You can find the log here.</a>
