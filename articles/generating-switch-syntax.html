      <h2>Generating Switch Statements for Syntax Highlighting</h2>
      <p>
        I'm working on <code>editorial</code>, a custom text editor.
        <code>editorial</code> is a terminal-based application that is a lot
        like the <code>nano</code> editor found on pretty much every Unix system.
        Like <code>nano</code>, I want my editor to be fast and responsive, even
        when doing complex operations on the text of a file. However, several weeks
        ago, I encountered a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The editor supported basic syntax highlighting for keywords in C++,
        but the highlighting code wasn't as efficient as I wanted it to be.
        Basically, the original code looked something like this:
      </p>
        <hr>
        <pre><code>
    void highlight_cpp(Screen &screen)
    {
        for(int row = 0; row < screen.size(); ++row) {
            int column = 0
            while(column < screen[row].size()) {
                switch(screen[row][column]) {
                case 'a':
                    if(matches(row, column, "auto") {
                        screen.highlight(row, column, column+4);
                        column += 4;
                    }
                    break;
                case 'b':
                    if(matches(row, column, "bool") {
                        screen.highlight(row, column, column+4);
                        column += 4;
                    } else if(matches(row, column, "break") {
                        screen.highlight(row, column, column+5);
                        column += 5;
                    }
                    break;
                case 'c':
                    if(matches(row, column, "case") {
                        screen.highlight(row, column, column+4);
                        column += 4;
                    } else if(....) {
                        ....
                ....
                default:
                    ++col;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
                                     </code></pre>

      <p>
        The idea is simple: only highlight the text currently shown on the
        screen (thus making highlighting faster for large files) and try to speed
        up highlighting by using a <code>switch</code> to narrow down the search
        based on the first letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This worked okay, and it was fast enough to be usable, but the inefficiency
        bothered me. Why should the editor have to search through each of the
        possible keywords that start with 'b', for instance, in order to get to
        "break"? Would it be possible to have another <code>switch</code>
        statement to check the second letter, the third letter, and so on, in
        a massive, nested <code>switch</code> statement? That way, each letter
        onscreen would only be checked once. Getting to "break" would only
        require a jump to 'b' and a jump to 'r' rather than a jump to 'b' and a
        linear search of all other keywords starting with 'b'. The code that I
        wanted looked something like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code>
    void highlight_cpp(Screen &screen)
    {
        for(int row = 0; row < screen.size(); ++row) {
            int column = 0
            while(column < screen[row].size()) {
                switch(screen[row][column]) {
                case 'a':
                    switch(screen[row][column++]) {
                    case 'u':
                        switch(column++) {       
                        case 't':
                            switch(column++) {
                            case 'o':
                                screen.highlight(row, column-3, column);
                                break;
                            }
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    break;

                     switch(screen[row][column++]) {

                         }

                                case 'k':

        However, this would be incredibly tedious to write by hand for the dozens of
        types and keywords I wanted to highlight. There had to be a way to automate
        these nested <code>switch</code> statements in code so that I could simply
        do something like this, with a <code>switch</code> statement as the implementation
        of the <code>matcher.contains()</code> function:
      </p>
      <hr>
      <pre><code>
      Matcher m;
      m.add_match("bool");
      m.add_match("break");
      m.add_match("auto");
      ....
      for(auto &row : screen) {
          int column = 0;
          while(column < row.size()) {
              if(int len = matcher.contains(row, column)) {
                  screen.highlight(row, column, column+len);
              }
          }
      }
      </code></pre>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Since the C++ language has no easy way to generate <code>switch</code>
        statements at compile-time, I wrote a simple code generation tool as a separate
        program that builds up a tree structure to represent the nested <code>switch</code>'s
        and then writes the necessary code into a file. This generated file is
        then compiled as part of the main program's build, providing the necessary
        highlighting code as a specialized function.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this method was fun to implement, it is likely
        inefficient due to the frequent branch misses that will occur due to the
        extreme nesting of massive <code>switch</code> statements. Nonetheless,
        I added it for now to my editor until I think of a better way to automatically
        create highlighting rules.
