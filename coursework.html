      <h2>Coursework</h2>
      <p>
	Here are the relevant courses I have taken during my time at the University
	of Arizona:
      </p>
      <h3>Web Programming (Spring 2019)</h3>
      <p>
	This course covered HTML, CSS, and client/server-side JavaScript in depth,
	while introducing me to databases, cookies/sessions, and basic web security.
	The class was challenging, but it allowed me to explore the web as a platform
	to make interactive applications. My creative final project (a web app to generate NCAA
	tournament brackets and search player stats) can be found
	<a href="http://march-madness-app.herokuapp.com/main.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction to Computer Programming II (Spring 2019)</h3>
      <p>
	This course greatly expanded my knowledge of data structures and general
	software development. I studied stacks, queues, trees, software testing,
	exception/error handling, Markov chains, object-oriented programming,
	recursion, searching, and sorting. One of the most useful courses I've taken
	on any subject.
      </p>
      <h3>Introduction to Computer Programming I (Fall 2018)</h3>
      <p>
	This course introduced me to the Python programming language and expanded on
	the basic skills I had developed through self-learning with more formal names
	and definitions.
