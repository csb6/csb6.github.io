      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
	Here are my publicly released projects, in varying states of
	completion. Ordered roughly by date of creation:
      </p>
      <h3>Event Simulator (May 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/event-simulator">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A simulation module based on Markov chains. Custom simulations can be
	created/run by specifying states/transitions in a JSON file and Python
	code in a second file to be executed after each event.
      </p>
      <p>
	This was a quick project, but a fascinating way to apply Markov chains
	to something beyond making text. I also experimented with passing
	functions as arguments and organizing the program in an object-oriented way.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language/Technology: Python</li>
	<li>Create an unlimited number of states/transitions</li>
	<li>Assign probabilities that each transition occurs</li>
	<li>Structured as a reusable Python module</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>March Madness Bracket Generator (April 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/uacs337spring2019/final-project-march-madness">Repository</a>
      <a href="http://march-madness-app.herokuapp.com/main.html">Link to Web App</a>
      <p>
	A web app that allows users to auto-generate an NCAA Tournament bracket
	based on a selected team statistic, as well as search for information
	about each team's roster.
      </p>
      <p>
	This was my creative final project for my Web Programming
	course, and so I made use of just about all of the material we covered,
	including databases, client/server-side code, and page design. I also
	gained valuable experience with deploying/updating web applications
	onto a hosting service.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language/Technology: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, SQL, Heroku</li>
	<li>See the accuracy of the generated bracket</li>
	<li>Persistently save/load brackets to the server</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tk-Code (August-September 2018)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/tk-code">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A basic text editor. I spent a lot of time trying to cleanly organize
	the app into classes (ex: a Document class for open documents, a
	Menu class for managing the OS's menubar).
      </p>
      <p>
	While I did not implement a fully featured IDE, the editor is still
	usable when working with multiple files and simple command-line tasks.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language/Technology: Ruby, Tk</li>
	<li>Edit multiply files at once using a tabbed view</li>
	<li>Collapsable tree view of the working directory</li>
	<li>Simple integrated terminal emulator</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Squad Tactical Game (May-July 2018)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/squad-tactical-game">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A 2D, top-down, turn-based tactical game based on the X-COM series. The
	code is a bit messy because I experimented with inheritance and later
	a component-based structure for the game's entity objects, but most
	features are implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
	The most notable portion of the project
	is my implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm, which allows the
	soldiers to move to a clicked location, avoiding any obstacles along
	the way. One of my most fun (and challenging) projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Language/Technology: Ruby, Tk</li>
	<li>Click to move: soldiers will pathfind to selected location.</li>
	<li>Chance to hit/damage varies with distance, nearby cover</li>
	<li>Simple CSV format for level creation</li>
	<li>Simple enemy AI that flanks your soldiers</li>
      </ul>
