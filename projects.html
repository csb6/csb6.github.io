      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
	Here are my publicly released projects, in varying states of
	completion. Ordered roughly by date of creation:
      </p>
      <h3>Editor (November 2019-present)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/editor">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A small text editor written using the FLTK GUI library. This
	was a great opportunity to learn more about working with
	others' documentation (and all of the surprises that come with it),
	as well as expand my experience with GUI programming.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span>
	  C++17, FLTK 1.3.5</li>
	<li>Custom coloring of text and background</li>
	<li>System menu specializes for macOS's menu system (menu is on the
	  taskbar), while menu is widget in main window for all other systems</li>
	<li>Save, Save As, and Open operations for files
	  using <code>CMD-S</code>, <code>CMD-Shift-S</code>, and
	  <code>CMD-O</code></li>
	<li>Basic support for font-loading</li>
	<li>Line numbers</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advent of Code Solutions (December 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/advent-of-code">Repository</a>
      <p>
	My solutions for the 2019 Advent of Code programming challenge,
	which <a href="https://adventofcode.com">runs annually</a> and consists
	of a series of short programmining puzzles. This was a really fun
	opportunity to test my knowledge of C++, CS concepts, and my math
	abilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> C++17</li>
	<li>Most solutions are a couple hundred lines long, and try
	  to be as readable as possible while still being relatively concise</li>
	<li>I'm continuing to finish up all 25 problems as I find time</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      
      <h3>Backtrack (October 2019-Present</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/Backtrack">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A work-in-progress C++ library intended to replicate some of the
	functionality of the logic programming language Prolog. While my
	goal is to eventually support a full backtracking and unification
	system as in Prolog, right now it only has basic support for facts and
	rules, as well as support for inferring the missing elements of
	facts.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> C++17</li>
	<li>Heavy use of template metaprogramming</li>
	<li>Partially type-safe at compile time; checks that can't be
	  done at compile-time are done at run-time</li>
	<li>Build a database full of basic facts, then query it, getting
	  true or false as an answer to each query</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      
      <h3>Ginevra (November 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/ginevra">Repository</a>
      <p>
	An extremely basic C++ preprocessor that supports only <code>#define</code>
	directives, based on a lesson in Arthur Pyster's book
	<em>Compiler Design and Construction</em>. It includes a lexer,
	symbol table, and error-checking, and it substitutes tokens in a
	source code file with the text indicated by each <code>#define</code>.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> C++17</li>
	<li>Support for simple <code>#define</code> directives</li>
	<li>Substantial error checking</li>
	<li>Two implementations (one OOP and one more procedural)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Rougelike Game (July 2019-Present)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/rougelike">Repository</a>
      <p>
	An in-progress rougelike computer game with short-range teleportation
	as a key game mechanic. I attempted this project as a way to gain
	experience in C++ and object-oriented programming, as well as
	UI design (in a text-based setting). I have also been learning to
	use compiler tools, such as the clang-tidy linter, to make my code
	clearer and less bug-prone.
      </p>
      <p>Note: currently only support for macOS</p>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> C++11, Bash,
	  <a href="https://github.com/nsf/termbox">Termbox</a>
	</li>
	<li>Character creation/character sheet with stats</li>
	<li>RNG melee/ranged combat takes into account characters'
	  armor/weapons</li>
	<li>AI-controlled monsters attempt to close-in on the player</li>
	<li>Specify stats of custom monsters/items using .ini files</li>
	<li>Map files are created as simple .csv files</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bthreads (August 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/bthreads">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A Python library supporting behavioral programming (BP), an experimental
	programming paradigm focused on creating separate behaviors or
	<em>b-threads</em> to be run in parallel or as coroutines. My implementation
	uses Python generators as a sort of coroutine.
      </p>
      <p>
	The aim of BP is to write code incrementally, with each b-thread waiting for,
	blocking, or requesting events to occur. Since all actions the b-threads
	take have to be requested before they can happen, they are much easier to
	reason about than dense, interdependent code. Simply by looking at a log
	of events, developers can easily develop in an <em>append-only</em> style, adding
	new behaviors to change the sequence of events that are triggered without
	knowing or caring about the code in prior behaviors.
      </p>
      <p>
	See the repository README for a more in-depth explanation with examples.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> Python</li>
	<li>Write b-threads like normal Python generators</li>
	<li>
	  Repository has example of fairly complex 2-player tic-tac-toe
	  program which validates each player's moves and checks for winning
	  conditions.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mail.py (May-June 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/mail.py">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A bare-bones IMAP email client in Tkinter, still not feature-complete.
	Right now, it supports loading/viewing the messages in an email
	account's inbox and sending plaintext messages from the same account.
      </p>
      <p>
	The purpose of this project was to see how far I could push my Python
	skillset, and while I managed to get the very basic features implemented,
	parsing messages, which come in a variety of HTML and plaintext formats,
	proved difficult. Interacting with the IMAP protocol also took more effort
	than I expected. However, the client still works as a simple email inbox
	viewer and message sender.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span>
	  Python, Tk, IMAP, SQLite</li>
	<li>Load your inbox into a local SQL database</li>
	<li>Send emails</li>
	<li>Uses Model-View-Adapter architecture to keep code decoupled</li>
	<li>See senders, subjects, time of sending for all messages</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Event Simulator (May 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/event-simulator">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A simulation module based on Markov chains. Custom simulations can be
	created/run by specifying states/transitions in a JSON file and Python
	code in a second file to be executed after each event.
      </p>
      <p>
	This was a quick project, but a fascinating way to apply Markov chains
	to something beyond making text. I also experimented with passing
	functions as arguments and organizing the program in an object-oriented way.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> Python</li>
	<li>Create an unlimited number of states/transitions</li>
	<li>Assign probabilities that each transition occurs</li>
	<li>Structured as a reusable Python module</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>March Madness Bracket Generator (April 2019)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/uacs337spring2019/final-project-march-madness">Repository</a>
      <a href="http://march-madness-app.herokuapp.com/main.html">Link to Web App</a>
      <p>
	A web app that allows users to auto-generate an NCAA Tournament bracket
	based on a selected team statistic, as well as search for information
	about each team's roster.
      </p>
      <p>
	This was my creative final project for my Web Programming
	course, and so I made use of just about all of the material we covered,
	including databases, client/server-side code, and page design. I also
	gained valuable experience with deploying/updating web applications
	onto a hosting service.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span>
	  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, SQL, Heroku</li>
	<li>See the accuracy of the generated bracket</li>
	<li>Persistently save/load brackets to the server</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tk-Code (August-September 2018)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/tk-code">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A basic text editor. I spent a lot of time trying to cleanly organize
	the app into classes (ex: a Document class for open documents, a
	Menu class for managing the OS's menubar).
      </p>
      <p>
	While I did not implement a fully featured IDE, the editor is still
	usable when working with multiple files and simple command-line tasks.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> Ruby, Tk</li>
	<li>Edit multiply files at once in a tabbed view</li>
	<li>Collapsable tree view of the working directory</li>
	<li>Simple integrated terminal emulator</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Squad Tactical Game (May-July 2018)</h3>
      <a href="https://github.com/csb6/squad-tactical-game">Repository</a>
      <p>
	A 2D, top-down, turn-based tactical game based on the X-COM series. The
	code is a bit messy because I experimented with inheritance and later
	a component-based structure for the game's entity objects, but most
	features are implemented.
      </p>
      <p>
	The most interesting portion of the project
	is my implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm, which allows the
	soldiers to move to a clicked location, avoiding any obstacles along
	the way. One of my most fun (and challenging) projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li><span class="project-label">Language/Technology:</span> Ruby, Tk</li>
	<li>Click to move: soldiers will pathfind to selected location.</li>
	<li>Chance to hit/damage varies with distance, nearby cover</li>
	<li>Simple CSV format for level creation</li>
	<li>Simple enemy AI that flanks your soldiers</li>
      </ul>
